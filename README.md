# 🌍 Life Expectancy Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project explores global **life expectancy trends** using data analytics and automated exploratory data analysis tools.  
It was completed as part of my **Machine Learning coursework** at Texas A&M University–Commerce.

---

## Objective
To analyze the relationship between life expectancy and multiple factors such as GDP, education, healthcare spending, and immunization rates using Python and EDA techniques.

---

## Tools & Technologies
- **Python 3.12**
- **Pandas**, **NumPy**
- **Matplotlib**, **Seaborn**
- **Sweetviz** for Auto EDA
- **Jupyter Notebook**

---

## Key Steps
1. Imported and cleaned the dataset (handled missing and duplicate values).  
2. Generated an **automated EDA report** using Sweetviz for summary statistics and visualization.  
3. Explored correlations between numeric features and life expectancy.  
4. Built basic regression models to predict life expectancy based on key health and economic indicators.

---

## Challenges Faced
- Handling missing and inconsistent data across multiple countries.  
- Managing categorical variables during model training.  
- Interpreting correlation strength among highly related features.

---

## Insights
- **Schooling, GDP, and healthcare expenditure** are the strongest predictors of life expectancy.  
- Countries with higher immunization rates tend to have significantly better longevity outcomes.  
- Regions with lower adult mortality show a consistent rise in life expectancy.
